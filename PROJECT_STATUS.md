# PROJECT STATUS - Plectic AI

## Executive Summary

Plectic AI is a functioning AI-powered search application for electrical distributors. The core technology works exceptionally well, delivering sub-second natural language search across multiple product categories. However, it lacks the business-critical features needed to generate revenue (authentication, quotes, ordering).

**Current State**: Advanced technical demo
**Needed for Revenue**: Business layer implementation

### 📝 TECHNICAL DEBT

Current technical debt is minimal:
- Test coverage needed
- Surface mount box table needs to be created in database
- Some fiber enclosures have NULL panel capacity values
- Documentation updates for new features needed

### ✅ RECENT UPDATES (January 2025)

**Phase 1 TypeScript Refactoring Completed:**
- Created comprehensive types package (`/types/`) with all type definitions
- Separated interfaces from implementation files
- Added environment variable validation (`/lib/env.ts`)
- Enhanced logger with performance tracking and Plectic AI specific features
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- All imports now use centralized type definitions
- Build completes successfully with no errors

**Phase 2 Feature Enhancements Completed:**
- Implemented complete analytics dashboard with charts
- Added cross-reference search functionality
- Created jack module search with compatibility matching
- Fixed faceplate search with color and port detection
- Added surface mount box (SMB) dedicated search
- Implemented fiber enclosure & adapter panel compatibility
- Added panel capacity search with "next size up" logic
- Enhanced box quantity to feet conversion for cables
- Fixed all TypeScript strict mode compliance issues

### 🏆 PROJECT STRENGTHS

1. **Excellent Search UX** - Natural language understanding works remarkably well
2. **Fast Performance** - Sub-second searches with smart caching
3. **Clean Architecture** - Well-organized, maintainable code
4. **Scalable Design** - Can handle significant growth
5. **Modern Tech Stack** - Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind
6. **Industry Knowledge** - Proper implementation of electrical standards
7. **Smart Compatibility** - Automatic matching of compatible products
8. **Cross-Reference** - Find alternatives across manufacturers
9. **Advanced Filtering** - Panel capacity, color, port count detection

### ⚠️ PROJECT RISKS

1. **No Revenue Generation** - Missing business-critical features
2. **Limited Product Catalog** - Only ~500 products vs 5,000+ goal
3. **No Authentication** - Can't track users or provide customer pricing
4. **Manual Processes** - Product updates require database access
5. **Single Tenant** - No multi-company support
6. **Missing Table** - Surface mount box table not yet created in database

### 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Priority**: Implement authentication and quote generation
2. **Hire/Partner**: Consider bringing in someone with experience in B2B e-commerce
3. **Customer Feedback**: Start getting feedback even without full features
4. **Incremental Rollout**: Launch with basic features, iterate based on usage
5. **Focus on MRR**: Build features that generate recurring revenue

### 📅 SUGGESTED TIMELINE

**Month 1**: Authentication, Quotes, Email (MVP for revenue)
**Month 2**: Pricing, Admin Panel, PDF Export
**Month 3**: Analytics, Integration APIs, Mobile Design
**Month 4+**: Advanced features based on customer needs
