# PROJECT STATUS - Plectic AI

## Executive Summary

Plectic AI is a functioning AI-powered search application for electrical distributors. The core technology works exceptionally well, delivering sub-second natural language search across multiple product categories. However, it lacks the business-critical features needed to generate revenue (authentication, quotes, ordering).

**Current State**: Advanced technical demo
**Needed for Revenue**: Business layer implementation

3. ERP integration
4. Advanced pricing rules
5. Automated inventory sync
6. Multi-location support
7. API for customer integration

### 📝 TECHNICAL DEBT

Current technical debt is minimal:
- Analytics dashboard component missing
- Some TypeScript types could be more specific
- Logger integration incomplete
- Test coverage needed

### 🏆 PROJECT STRENGTHS

1. **Excellent Search UX** - Natural language understanding works remarkably well
2. **Fast Performance** - Sub-second searches with smart caching
3. **Clean Architecture** - Well-organized, maintainable code
4. **Scalable Design** - Can handle significant growth
5. **Modern Tech Stack** - Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind
6. **Industry Knowledge** - Proper implementation of electrical standards

### ⚠️ PROJECT RISKS

1. **No Revenue Generation** - Missing business-critical features
2. **Limited Product Catalog** - Only ~368 products vs 5,000+ goal
3. **No Authentication** - Can't track users or provide customer pricing
4. **Manual Processes** - Product updates require database access
5. **Single Tenant** - No multi-company support

### 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Priority**: Implement authentication and quote generation
2. **Hire/Partner**: Consider bringing in someone with experience in B2B e-commerce
3. **Customer Feedback**: Start getting feedback even without full features
4. **Incremental Rollout**: Launch with basic features, iterate based on usage
5. **Focus on MRR**: Build features that generate recurring revenue

### 📅 SUGGESTED TIMELINE

**Month 1**: Authentication, Quotes, Email (MVP for revenue)
**Month 2**: Pricing, Admin Panel, PDF Export
**Month 3**: Analytics, Integration APIs, Mobile Design
**Month 4+**: Advanced features based on customer needs
