# Plectic AI - Electrical Distribution Search Assistant

An AI-powered search assistant for electrical distributors, enabling natural language queries to find electrical components quickly and accurately.

## Overview

Plectic AI transforms how electrical distributors search for products by understanding natural language queries like "I need blue cat6 plenum cable" or "LC connectors for OM4 fiber" and returning relevant results in milliseconds.

### Key Features

- **Shopping List Management**: Build and manage quotes with quantity tracking and compatibility
- **Cross-Reference Search**: Find equivalent products across different manufacturers
- **Compatibility Matching**: Automatically matches compatible products (jacks/faceplates, enclosures/panels)
- **Industry Knowledge**: Built-in understanding of electrical standards and equivalencies
- **Fast Performance**: Average search time ~300ms with AI caching
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time search analytics and performance metrics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/electrical-ai-assistant-fresh.git
cd electrical-ai-assistant-fresh
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your keys to `.env.local`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# For Decision Engine (optional)
USE_DECISION_ENGINE=shadow  # Options: disabled, shadow, production
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

## Usage Examples

### Natural Language Queries
- "I need 500ft of blue cat6 plenum cable"
- "Show me LC connectors for OM4 fiber"
- "Corning products"
- "4RU fiber enclosure"
- "Part number 7131100"
- "cat6 jack panduit minicom"
- "2 port white faceplate"
- "20 2 port smb black"
- "panduit alternative to corning cch-01u"
- "6 panel fiber enclosure"
- "box of 1000ft cat6 plenum"

### Features in Action
1. **Smart Search**: Understands specifications, quantities, and technical requirements
2. **Business Rules**: Automatically redirects Cat5 to Cat5e, detects SMB abbreviations
3. **Filter Generation**: Creates relevant filters based on your search results
4. **Shopping List**: Add items with quantities for quote building
5. **Compatibility**: Automatically matches compatible products (jacks â†” faceplates)
6. **Cross-Reference**: Find equivalent products across manufacturers
7. **Panel Capacity**: Shows exact match or next size up for fiber enclosures

## Decision Engine Migration

The Decision Engine is a new architecture that solves cascading search failures when adding new product types.

### Key Features
- **Immutable Decision Pipeline**: Prevents functions from overriding each other
- **Clear Precedence Rules**: Business Rules â†’ Part Numbers â†’ Context â†’ AI â†’ Text â†’ Fallback
- **Shadow Mode Testing**: Run both engines in parallel to verify no regressions
- **Audit Trail**: Every decision is logged for debugging

### Enabling the Decision Engine

1. **Shadow Mode** (recommended first step):
   ```bash
   USE_DECISION_ENGINE=shadow
   ```
   - Runs both old and new engines
   - Logs differences for analysis
   - Returns old results (safe)

2. **Monitor Shadow Mode**:
   - Visit `/admin/decision-engine` to see reports
   - Check API: `/api/admin/shadow-report`
   - Review divergences and confidence scores

3. **Production Mode** (after validation):
   ```bash
   USE_DECISION_ENGINE=production
   ```

### Database Setup
Run the SQL in `/database/decision_engine_tables.sql` to create:
- `search_decisions_audit` - Decision trail
- `shadow_mode_comparisons` - Divergence tracking
- `regression_tests` - Critical query tests
- Performance monitoring tables

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
npm run test        # Run test suite (when implemented)
npm run lint        # Run ESLint
npm run type-check  # Run TypeScript checks
```

### Debug Mode
Add `?debug=true` to the URL to see search internals including:
- Raw AI analysis
- Search parameters
- Query timing
- Filter generation logic

## Deployment

The application is configured for automatic deployment on Vercel:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Vercel automatically builds and deploys
3. Production URL: [your-app.vercel.app]
