## Testing Checklist

Before deployment, test these queries:
- [ ] "I need 4 rack mount fiber enclosures 6 panel" → Should show 6-panel options
- [ ] "I need a wall mount fiber enclosure 10 panel" → Should show 24-panel (next size up)
- [ ] "cat6 jack panduit minicom" → Should show Panduit Mini-Com jacks
- [ ] "2 port white faceplate" → Should show white 2-port faceplates
- [ ] "20 2 port smb black" → Should show black surface mount boxes
- [ ] "panduit alternative to corning cch-01u" → Should show cross-references
- [ ] "2 boxes of 1000ft cat6 plenum" → Should search for 2000ft
- [ ] Check analytics dashboard at /analytics
- [ ] Add jack to cart, then search faceplates → Should filter by compatibility

## Known Issues

1. Surface mount box table doesn't exist in database yet (code is ready)
2. Some fiber enclosures have NULL panel capacity values
3. Limited product catalog (~500 products vs 5000+ goal)

## Build Status

```bash
npm run build
```
✅ Build completes successfully with no TypeScript errors

## Deployment Steps

1. Commit all changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically build and deploy
3. Check deployment logs for any issues
4. Test all features in production environment

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Vercel:
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

1. Monitor analytics for search performance
2. Check error logs for any runtime issues
3. Verify AI cache hit rates
4. Monitor database query performance
