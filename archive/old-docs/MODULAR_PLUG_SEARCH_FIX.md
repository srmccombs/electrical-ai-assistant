# Modular Plug Search Fix - June 18, 2025

## Issue
Searches for "modular plugs" were being incorrectly routed to jack_modules instead of the new modular_plugs table.

## Root Cause
The AI was classifying "modular plugs" as JACK_MODULE product type, and the enhancement function was supposed to override this but wasn't working reliably.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI Analysis Override (Already in place)
The `enhanceAIAnalysis` function checks for modular plug terms and overrides the AI's classification:
```javascript
// Line 120-135 in searchService.ts
if ((term.includes('modular plug') || term.includes('rj45') || term.includes('rj-45') || 
     term.includes('crimp connector') || term.includes('terminator plug') || 
     term.includes('ethernet connector') || term.includes('network plug') ||
     term.includes('crimp') || term.includes('crimps')) &&
    !term.includes('jack') && !term.includes('keystone')) {
  aiAnalysis.productType = 'MODULAR_PLUG'
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Added Fallback Detection (New)
Added a secondary check in `determineTargetTable` function as a failsafe:
```javascript
// Line 727-736 in searchService.ts
// PRIORITY 1.651: Double-check for modular plug in case enhancement failed
const lowerQuery = query.toLowerCase()
if ((lowerQuery.includes('modular plug') || lowerQuery.includes('rj45') || lowerQuery.includes('rj-45') || 
     lowerQuery.includes('crimp connector') || lowerQuery.includes('terminator plug') || 
     lowerQuery.includes('ethernet connector') || lowerQuery.includes('network plug') ||
     lowerQuery.includes('crimp') || lowerQuery.includes('crimps')) &&
    !lowerQuery.includes('jack') && !lowerQuery.includes('keystone')) {
  logger.info('FALLBACK: Modular plug detected via keyword check - routing to modular_plugs', {}, LogCategory.SEARCH)
  return 'modular_plugs'
}
```

### 3. Verified Configuration
- Confirmed that jack_modules keywords do NOT contain "plug" anywhere
- Confirmed that modular_plugs case exists in the routing switch statement
- Added debug logging to track modular plug routing

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Search for "modular plugs" - should route to modular_plugs table
2. Search for "I need 10 modular plugs" - should route to modular_plugs table
3. Search for "rj45 connectors" - should route to modular_plugs table
4. Search for "crimp connectors" - should route to modular_plugs table
5. Search for "jack modules" - should still route to jack_modules table
6. Search for "keystone jacks" - should still route to jack_modules table

## Key Points
- The word "plug" does NOT appear in jack module search terms
- Modular plug detection has higher priority than jack module detection
- Double fallback ensures proper routing even if AI enhancement fails
- Clear separation between jack modules (receptacles) and modular plugs (cable terminators)
