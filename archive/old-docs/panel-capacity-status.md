# Panel Capacity Search Status

## Current Behavior
When searching "I need 2 fiber enclosures 10 panel":
- ✅ Correctly detects quantity: 2
- ✅ Routes to fiber enclosure search
- ❌ Returns 10 mixed results (5 wall + 5 rack) without panel filtering
- ❌ Should return only enclosures with 10+ panels

## Available Panel Capacities in Data

### Rack Mount Enclosures
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 panels
- For 10-panel request → Should show 12-panel options

### Wall Mount Enclosures  
- 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96 panels (some empty values)
- For 10-panel request → Should show 24-panel options

## What's Working
1. ✅ Rack mount specific search: "I need 4 Rack mount fiber enclosure 6 panel" → Returns 1 result (6-panel)
2. ✅ Panel capacity detection is working in the functions
3. ✅ Next size up logic is implemented

## What Needs Fixing
1. Generic fiber enclosure search ("fiber enclosure" without specifying wall/rack) doesn't apply panel capacity filtering
2. The mixed search path splits the limit but both searches should filter by panel capacity

## Expected Results for "10 panel"
Should return only:
- Rack Mount: 12-panel enclosures (CCH-04U, FRME4, FCE4U)
- Wall Mount: 24-panel enclosures (FWME1BL)

## Debug Steps
1. Check if `detectPanelCapacity` is being called in both search paths
2. Verify panel capacity is passed through when doing mixed search
3. Ensure the limit split doesn't interfere with filtering
