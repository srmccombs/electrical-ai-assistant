# Knowledge System Design

## Overview

The Knowledge System allows users to contribute electrical industry expertise, creating a learning search engine that improves daily. This creates a competitive moat Google cannot replicate.

## Core Concept

**"Every search makes the system smarter for the next user"**

## Knowledge Types

### 1. Synonyms
- "SMB" = "Surface Mount Box"
- "Cat 6" = "Category 6"
- Regional variations

### 2. Product Relationships
- "If they need Cat6 cable, they also need RJ45 connectors"
- "This replaces that older product"
- "These work together"

### 3. Corrections
- Spelling fixes
- Terminology updates
- Legacy term redirects

### 4. Context
- "This is for indoor use only"
- "Requires special tools"
- "Check local codes"

### 5. Mappings
- "When they say X, they mean product type Y"
- Industry-specific interpretations

## User Interface Strategy

### Button Placement

1. **After Failed Searches** (Highest Priority)
   ```
   No results found for "ethernet cable cat 6"
   [Help us learn what you were looking for]
   ```

2. **On Product Pages**
   ```
   Product: Panduit CJ688TGBU
   [Know another name for this?]
   ```

3. **After Successful Searches**
   ```
   Found 12 results
   [Add a nickname customers use]
   ```

4. **When User Refines Search**
   ```
   You searched "A" then "B" and found what you needed
   [Connect these searches for others]
   ```

## Validation Framework

### Automatic Approval (High Trust)
- User reputation > 100
- Matches existing patterns
- Multiple users suggest same thing

### Expert Review Required
- Contradicts business rules
- New user contribution
- Affects critical products

### A/B Testing
- Test with 10% of searches
- Measure click-through improvement
- Auto-deploy if successful

### Rollback Protection
- Monitor search success rate
- Auto-revert if degradation
- Alert on anomalies

## Gamification & Recognition

### Individual Level
1. **Reputation Score**
   - +10 for approved contribution
   - +2 for each contribution
   - -5 for rejected
   - +1 for every 10 searches helped

2. **Badges**
   - Cable Expert (50+ cable contributions)
   - Fiber Specialist (30+ fiber contributions)
   - Top Contributor (100+ approved)
   - Knowledge Champion (30-day streak)

3. **Impact Metrics**
   - "Your suggestions helped 247 searches this month"
   - "You saved users 18 hours of search time"

### Company Level
1. **Leaderboard**
   - Most contributions
   - Highest quality score
   - Most diverse knowledge

2. **Recognition**
   - "Most Collaborative Distributor 2025"
   - Newsletter features
   - Conference speaking opportunities

## Competitive Advantages

### Why Google Can't Replicate
1. **Domain Experts**: Our users are electrical professionals
2. **Validated Knowledge**: Every contribution is tested
3. **Industry Context**: We understand "non-plenum" = "CMR"
4. **B2B Patterns**: Commercial purchasing behaviors
