# Panel Capacity Search Fix

## Problem
When searching "I need 4 fiber enclosures 6 Panel", the system was returning all fiber enclosures instead of filtering by the 6-panel capacity requirement.

## Root Cause
1. The search was hitting the "general enclosure search" strategy because it contained the word "enclosure"
2. The general enclosure search wasn't checking for panel capacity
3. The panel capacity detection was working but not being used in the general search path

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Panel Capacity Detection
Updated the `detectPanelCapacity` function to better handle complex queries:
- Now finds all numbers in the query and checks if they're followed by panel-related keywords
- Handles queries like "I need 4 fiber enclosures 6 panel" where "4" is quantity and "6" is panel capacity
- Added more keywords: 'panel', 'adapter', 'capacity', 'holds', 'slot', 'fap', 'cassette'

### 2. Updated General Enclosure Search Strategy
Modified STRATEGY 2 to check for panel capacity:
- If panel capacity is detected, it now filters by that first
- Implements the same "exact match or next size up" logic
- Only falls back to general search if no panel capacity is specified

## How It Works Now

For query: "I need 4 fiber enclosures 6 Panel"
1. Detects "6" followed by "panel" â†’ panel capacity = 6
2. Searches for enclosures with exactly 6 panels
3. If none exist (as in your data), finds the next size up (8 panels)
4. Returns only the 8-panel enclosures, not all enclosures

## Available Panel Capacities in Your Data
- Rack Mount: 2, 3, 4, 12 panels
- Wall Mount: 1, 2, 4, 8 panels

So a search for "6 panel" should return:
- Rack Mount: 12-panel enclosures (next size up)
- Wall Mount: 8-panel enclosures (next size up)
