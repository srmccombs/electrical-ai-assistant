## ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR UPDATE: Decision Engine is Live!

The Decision Engine is now deployed and running in shadow mode:
- **Zero User Impact**: Returns existing search results while testing new engine
- **Full Audit Trail**: Every decision is logged to database
- **Admin Dashboard**: Monitor at `/admin/decision-engine`
- **Knowledge System**: User contributions table active with 4 test entries

### Next Steps (IMPORTANT):
1. **Add Vercel Environment Variable**: `USE_DECISION_ENGINE=shadow`
2. **Monitor Shadow Mode**: Check divergences daily for 1-2 weeks
3. **Create Database Function**: `increment_knowledge_usage` (currently disabled)
4. **Switch to Production**: After successful shadow testing

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev         # Start development server on http://localhost:3000

# Build & Production
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run start       # Start production server

# Code Quality
npm run lint        # Run ESLint
```

## Key Architecture Components

### API Routes
- `/app/api/ai-search/route.js` - Analyzes natural language queries using OpenAI to determine product types and search parameters
- `/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Handles real-time chat interactions with streaming responses

### Search Service Architecture
The search system (`/services/searchService.ts`) orchestrates:
1. Query validation and business rule application (Cat5 â†’ Cat5e redirection)
2. Part number detection for direct lookups
3. AI analysis to determine product type and specifications
4. Table-specific search implementations based on product type
5. Smart filter generation from results

### Specialized Search Implementations
Located in `/search/` directory:
- `categoryCables/` - Searches for ethernet cables (Cat5e, Cat6, etc.) with box quantity conversion
- `fiberCables/` - Searches for fiber optic cables
- `fiberConnectors/` - Searches for fiber connectors (LC, SC, ST, etc.) - includes "fiber ends" synonym
- `fiberadapterPanels/` - Searches for adapter panels with fiber enclosure compatibility
- `fiberenclosure/` - Searches for both rack mount and wall mount fiber enclosures with panel capacity filtering
- `jackModules/` - Searches for RJ45 jacks with faceplate/SMB compatibility
- `faceplates/` - Searches for wall plates with jack compatibility - includes Ports and Gang filters
- `surfaceMountBoxes/` - Searches for surface mount boxes (SMB) with jack compatibility - includes Ports and Gang filters
- `shared/industryKnowledge.ts` - Contains business rules and electrical industry patterns
- `shared/tableDiscoveryService.ts` - Dynamic table discovery for new product types

### Database Integration
Uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) with tables:
- `category_cables` - Ethernet cables (Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a)
- `fiber_connectors` - LC, SC, ST, FC connectors
- `adapter_panels` - Fiber adapter panels with panel_type field
- `rack_mount_fiber_enclosures` - Rack mount enclosures with panel capacity filtering
- `wall_mount_fiber_enclosures` - Wall mount enclosures with panel capacity filtering
- `fiber_cables` - Single mode and multimode fiber cables
- `jack_modules` - RJ45 jacks with brand/product line compatibility
- `faceplates` - Wall plates with compatible_jacks field
- `surface_mount_box` - Surface mount boxes (SMB) with jack compatibility âœ… Created June 2025
- Dynamic table discovery via `tableDiscoveryService.ts`

Analytics tables:
- `search_analytics` - Tracks all searches and performance
- `search_analytics_summary` - Daily aggregated statistics
- `popular_searches` - Most searched terms

### UI Components
- `PlecticAI.tsx` - Main chat interface component with:
  - Real-time streaming responses
  - Shopping list with quantity management and compatibility context
  - Smart filter generation
  - Debug mode toggle
  - Fiber type reference guide
  - Stock status indicators
  - Cross-reference results display
  - Product compatibility matching (jacks/faceplates, enclosures/panels)
  - Toast notifications for copy confirmations
  - Copy List button to copy entire shopping list
  - Email List button with brand included in format
- `Toast.tsx` - Toast notification component with dynamic positioning
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Graceful error handling wrapper
- `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - Complete analytics dashboard with charts and metrics
- `app/analytics/page.tsx` - Analytics dashboard page

## Environment Variables Required

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Important Business Rules

1. **Cat5 â†’ Cat5e Redirection**: All Cat5 searches automatically redirect to Cat5e (current standard)
2. **Jacket Rating Mappings**: 
   - PVC = Riser = CMR = Non-Plenum (all equivalent)
   - CMP = Plenum
3. **Brand-Only Searches**: Single brand name queries search across all product tables
4. **Part Number Priority**: Direct part number matches take precedence over AI analysis
5. **SMB Detection**: "SMB" and variations route to surface_mount_box table
6. **Compatibility Matching**:
   - Jack modules â†” Faceplates/Surface Mount Boxes (brand + product line)
   - Fiber Enclosures â†” Adapter Panels (panel_type field)
7. **Panel Capacity Search**: Shows exact match or next size up (e.g., request 6 panels â†’ show 8, not 12)
8. **Box Quantity Conversion**: Detects "box of X" and converts to feet for cables
9. **Fiber Terminology**: "fiber ends" is synonym for "fiber connectors"
10. **Fiber Pair Conversion**: Automatically converts fiber pairs to fiber count (3 pair = 6 fiber)
11. **Popular Searches Update**: "Face Plates" changed to "Datacom Face Plates"

## TypeScript Configuration

Strict mode is enabled. Key compiler options:
- `strict: true`
- Target: ES2017
- Module: ESNext
- JSX: preserve

## Testing the Decision Engine

1. **Shadow Mode Testing** (current state):
   - Visit any search query - it will use BOTH engines
   - Old engine results are shown to users
   - New engine results are logged for comparison
   - Check `/admin/decision-engine` for divergence reports

2. **Knowledge System Testing**:
   - Try "s.m.b" â†’ should suggest "surface mount box"
   - Try "cat 5" â†’ should redirect to "cat5e"
   - These use the knowledge_contributions table

3. **Critical Queries to Test**:
   - "smb" â†’ Must go to surface_mount_box (not faceplates)
   - "2 port faceplate" â†’ Must go to faceplates (not SMB)
   - "cat6 jack panduit" â†’ Must go to jack_modules
   - "fiber connector lc" â†’ Must go to fiber_connectors

## Development Tips

1. When modifying search logic, test with various query patterns:
   - Part numbers: "7131100", "ABC-123-456"
   - Specifications: "cat6 plenum blue 1000ft"
   - Brand searches: "corning", "panduit"
   - Fiber queries: "LC connectors OM4", "12 strand fiber cable"
   - Jack searches: "cat6 jack panduit", "minicom jack modules"
   - Faceplate searches: "2 port white faceplate"
   - SMB searches: "20 2 port smb black"
   - Cross-reference: "panduit alternative to corning cch-01u"
   - Panel capacity: "6 panel fiber enclosure", "4 panel wall mount"

2. The AI analysis can be enhanced in `searchService.ts` using the `enhanceAIAnalysis` function for cases where GPT misses specifications

3. Each product type has its own filter generation logic - check the respective search implementation files

4. Shopping list functionality stores items in browser localStorage with quantity tracking

## TypeScript Best Practices

When working with TypeScript in this project:

1. **Error Handling**: Always type check errors in catch blocks
   ```typescript
   // Good
   catch (error) {
     const message = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)
   }
   
   // Bad
   catch (error) {
     console.log(error.message) // TypeScript error: 'error' is of type 'unknown'
   }
   ```

2. **Decision Engine**: When extending SearchDecision functionality:
   - Use public methods like `with()` for immutable updates
   - Don't access private methods from outside the class
   - Ensure all interface properties are defined in types.ts

3. **ESLint Configuration**: Use `.eslintrc.json` with `"extends": "next/core-web-vitals"`
- âœ… Component extraction for performance (FilterSection, ProductTable, SearchInput, ShoppingList)
- âœ… React memoization throughout (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- âœ… Enhanced fiber cable filters (jacket rating, product type, application, fiber count)
- âœ… Application filter parsing for bracketed lists
- âœ… Smart filter auto-centering on search results
- âœ… UI improvements (25% larger display, Clear Search button, conditional Clear List)
- âœ… Fiber Type Reference only shows with 2+ fiber types
- âœ… Auto-apply brand filters for SMBs when jack modules in cart
- âœ… Fixed faceplate searches excluding SMB products
- âœ… Fixed SMB database query errors (removed array field from ilike)
- âœ… Fixed Cat6 STP cable searches with proper shielding filters
- âœ… Search Feedback Button - Allows users to report failed searches

- Some fiber enclosures have NULL panel capacity values
- Analytics tracking returns 406 errors (needs backend fix)

## Decision Engine Migration (IN PROGRESS)

### Overview
We're migrating to a new Decision Engine architecture to solve cascading search failures when adding new product types. The engine uses an immutable decision pipeline with clear precedence rules.

### Key Problems Being Solved
1. **SMB vs Faceplate conflicts**: SMB detection now has highest priority
2. **AI vs Text Detection conflicts**: Clear precedence order prevents overrides
3. **Shopping list context**: Provides hints without forcing overrides
4. **Regression prevention**: Every successful search becomes a test case

### Migration Status
- âœ… Decision Engine core implemented
- âœ… All decision stages created (Business Rules, Part Number, Context, AI, Text Detection, Knowledge, Fallback)
- âœ… Shadow mode adapter ready
- âœ… Test suite complete
- âœ… Migration guide documented
- ðŸš§ Shadow mode deployment pending
- ðŸš§ Production rollout pending

### To Enable Shadow Mode
1. Set environment variable: `USE_DECISION_ENGINE=shadow`
2. Deploy and monitor for 1-2 weeks
3. Check `/api/admin/shadow-report` for divergences
4. When ready, switch to `USE_DECISION_ENGINE=production`

### Critical Queries to Test
- "cat6 plenum cable" â†’ category_cables
- "surface mount box" or "smb" â†’ surface_mount_box
- "2 port faceplate" â†’ faceplates
- "panduit jack cat6" â†’ jack_modules
- "CJ688TGBU" â†’ multi_table (part number)

See `DECISION_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for full details.
