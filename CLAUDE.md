# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered electrical distribution assistant built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript. The application helps users search for electrical components (cables, fiber connectors, adapter panels, enclosures) using natural language queries powered by OpenAI GPT-4o-mini.

- âœ… Performance optimization with component extraction
- âœ… Enhanced fiber cable filtering (count, jacket, type, application)
- âœ… Smart filter auto-centering
- âœ… Improved UI with 25% larger display
- ðŸš§ User authentication not implemented
- ðŸš§ Quote generation not implemented

## Key Architecture Components

### API Routes
- `/app/api/ai-search/route.js` - Analyzes natural language queries using OpenAI to determine product types and search parameters
- `/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Handles real-time chat interactions with streaming responses

### Search Service Architecture
The search system (`/services/searchService.ts`) orchestrates:
1. Query validation and business rule application (Cat5 â†’ Cat5e redirection)
2. Part number detection for direct lookups
3. AI analysis to determine product type and specifications
4. Table-specific search implementations based on product type
5. Smart filter generation from results

### Specialized Search Implementations
Located in `/search/` directory:
- `categoryCables/` - Searches for ethernet cables (Cat5e, Cat6, etc.) with box quantity conversion
- `fiberCables/` - Searches for fiber optic cables
- `fiberConnectors/` - Searches for fiber connectors (LC, SC, ST, etc.)
- `fiberadapterPanels/` - Searches for adapter panels with fiber enclosure compatibility
- `fiberenclosure/` - Searches for both rack mount and wall mount fiber enclosures with panel capacity filtering
- `jackModules/` - Searches for RJ45 jacks with faceplate/SMB compatibility
- `faceplates/` - Searches for wall plates with jack compatibility
- `surfaceMountBoxes/` - Searches for surface mount boxes (SMB) with jack compatibility
- `shared/industryKnowledge.ts` - Contains business rules and electrical industry patterns
- `shared/tableDiscoveryService.ts` - Dynamic table discovery for new product types

### Database Integration
Uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) with tables:
- `category_cables` - Ethernet cables (Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a)
- `fiber_connectors` - LC, SC, ST, FC connectors
- `adapter_panels` - Fiber adapter panels with panel_type field
- `rack_mount_fiber_enclosures` - Rack mount enclosures with panel capacity filtering
- `wall_mount_fiber_enclosures` - Wall mount enclosures with panel capacity filtering
- `fiber_cables` - Single mode and multimode fiber cables
- `jack_modules` - RJ45 jacks with brand/product line compatibility
- `faceplates` - Wall plates with compatible_jacks field
- `surface_mount_box` - Surface mount boxes (SMB) with jack compatibility
- Dynamic table discovery via `tableDiscoveryService.ts`

Analytics tables:
- `search_analytics` - Tracks all searches and performance
- `search_analytics_summary` - Daily aggregated statistics
- `popular_searches` - Most searched terms

### UI Components
- `PlecticAI.tsx` - Main chat interface component with:
  - Real-time streaming responses
  - Shopping list with quantity management and compatibility context
  - Smart filter generation
  - Debug mode toggle
  - Fiber type reference guide
  - Stock status indicators
  - Cross-reference results display
  - Product compatibility matching (jacks/faceplates, enclosures/panels)
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Graceful error handling wrapper
- `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - Complete analytics dashboard with charts and metrics
- `app/analytics/page.tsx` - Analytics dashboard page

## Environment Variables Required

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Important Business Rules

1. **Cat5 â†’ Cat5e Redirection**: All Cat5 searches automatically redirect to Cat5e (current standard)
2. **Jacket Rating Mappings**: 
   - PVC = Riser = CMR = Non-Plenum (all equivalent)
   - CMP = Plenum
3. **Brand-Only Searches**: Single brand name queries search across all product tables
4. **Part Number Priority**: Direct part number matches take precedence over AI analysis
5. **SMB Detection**: "SMB" and variations route to surface_mount_box table
6. **Compatibility Matching**:
   - Jack modules â†” Faceplates/Surface Mount Boxes (brand + product line)
   - Fiber Enclosures â†” Adapter Panels (panel_type field)
7. **Panel Capacity Search**: Shows exact match or next size up (e.g., request 6 panels â†’ show 8, not 12)
8. **Box Quantity Conversion**: Detects "box of X" and converts to feet for cables

## TypeScript Configuration

Strict mode is enabled. Key compiler options:
- `strict: true`
- Target: ES2017
- Module: ESNext
- JSX: preserve

## Development Tips

1. When modifying search logic, test with various query patterns:
   - Part numbers: "7131100", "ABC-123-456"
   - Specifications: "cat6 plenum blue 1000ft"
   - Brand searches: "corning", "panduit"
   - Fiber queries: "LC connectors OM4", "12 strand fiber cable"
   - Jack searches: "cat6 jack panduit", "minicom jack modules"
   - Faceplate searches: "2 port white faceplate"
   - SMB searches: "20 2 port smb black"
   - Cross-reference: "panduit alternative to corning cch-01u"
   - Panel capacity: "6 panel fiber enclosure", "4 panel wall mount"

2. The AI analysis can be enhanced in `searchService.ts` using the `enhanceAIAnalysis` function for cases where GPT misses specifications

3. Each product type has its own filter generation logic - check the respective search implementation files

4. Shopping list functionality stores items in browser localStorage with quantity tracking
