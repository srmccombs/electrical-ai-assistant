# Plectic AI Executive Summary

## 🚀 Elevator Pitch

**Plectic AI is ChatGPT for electrical distributors.** Instead of making contractors search through 20,000 SKUs with exact part numbers, they can type "I need 1200 feet of OM4 fiber cable" and instantly get the right products. Our AI understands electrical terminology, extracts quantities, and shows smart filters for refinement. Built on 35 years of distribution expertise, we reduce ordering errors by 80% and cut quote time from hours to minutes.

## 📊 The Problem

### Industry Pain Points
- **$31 billion** lost annually to ordering errors
- **4+ hours** average time for complex quotes  
- **70,000+ contractors** using outdated search tools
- **20,000+ SKUs** impossible to navigate efficiently

### Current Solution Failures
- ERP systems require exact part numbers
- No understanding of natural language
- No quantity extraction from requests
- Salespeople need deep product knowledge

## 💡 Our Solution

### Natural Language Search
```
Traditional: "Search part number FL-SM-12-ST-CMP-YL"
Plectic AI: "I need 12 strand single mode fiber with ST connectors"
```

### AI-Powered Intelligence
- Understands "Cat5" means "Cat5e" (industry standards)
- Knows "non-plenum" = "riser" = "CMR" 
- Extracts "1200 ft" and pre-fills quantity
- Routes fiber vs cable vs connector searches

### Smart Filters
- Instant refinement by brand, color, rating
- Visual cable colors (blue = blue background)
- Only shows relevant filters per product type
- One-click to clear specific filter types

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: PostgreSQL with smart search
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for understanding
- **Hosting**: Vercel + Supabase (scales automatically)
- **Search**: <50ms response times

### Smart Deployment Strategy
- **No ERP Integration Required** (SOC2 not needed)
- **Weekly Email Updates** (CSV/Excel import)
- **Deploy in Days** (not months)
- **Prove Value First** (then integrate)
